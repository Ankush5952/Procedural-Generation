This is a Unity project made to generate procedural terrain using Perlin Noise.

The settings work in the Editor with certain parameters like seed, amplitude, persistance, lacunarity, octaves, coordinate offsets, height multiplier, etc. to customize the noise and heightmap.

Generates a terrain mesh at the Start of runtime.

There is a player character thar can move using standard controls(WASD) to explore the terrain in-game.

The project is a work in progress with more features to come.
